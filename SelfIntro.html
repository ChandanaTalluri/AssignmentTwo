          <p><em>
              I am Chandana Talluri. I am from India, I did my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication
              Engineering (ECE) from G. Narayanamma Institute of Technology and Science (For Women), Hyderabad, India in
              the year 2016. Though my major is in electronics my college also offered some programming classes as well
              in the curriculum.
              I liked programming over working with electronic components, so I have focused on learning different
              programming languages and cracked the campus interview in Infosys company, which is Ranked Number 3 on
              2019 Forbes World's Best Regarded Companies List.
              I have joined in Infosys as Systems Engineer in May 2016 i.e. right after completion of my bachelor’s and
              after one year, I got promoted Senior System Engineer. I have worked 3.5 years at Infosys.

            </em>
